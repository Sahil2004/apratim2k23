					1.1. TASK:<br />
					Teams will need to create an independent robot that can
					follow a white line while traversing through the trackand
					maintain its direction.<br />
					1.2. ARENA:<br />
					The arena will be about 150cm x 150cm (l x b) in size and
					will consist of randomly placed white strips. The angle
					between two consecutive white lines will be either 45° or
					90°. A white box measuring 30 cm x 30 cm will be at the End
					Zone to signify the completion of the track.<br />
					1.3. GAMEPLAY:<br />
					The game consists of two parts:<br />
					• The first part is the “Dry Run”. In this run, the bot must
					start from the 'Start' position and find its way to the
					‘End’ (White box) of the arena. The bot must follow an
					algorithm to reach the 'End'. There are no restrictions on
					covering all the checkpoints.<br />
					• The second part is the “Actual Run”. In this run, the bot
					must start again from the 'Start' and find its way to the
					‘End’. The ‘End Zone’ will have a white box of 300mm x 300mm
					(l x b) indicating the end of the path for the bot. The
					timer will be set to zero as the “Actual Run” begins.<br />
					• A total of 3 minutes will be provided to complete the Dry
					Run.<br />
					• A total of 2 minutes and 45 seconds will be provided to
					complete the Actual Run.<br />
					1.4. BOT SPECIFICATIONS:<br />
					• The autonomous bot must fit into the box of dimensions
					25cm x 18cm x 18cm (l x b x h).<br />
					• The bot must have an LED that will light up once it
					reaches the end zone of the arena.<br />
					• The bot must have an onboard power supply. The potential
					difference between any two points must not exceed 24V during
					the game when using the electric power supply.<br />
					• The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two
					or more units. All bots/units that are touching each other
					or are in the starting point will be considered as one
					bot.<br />
					• The autonomous bot cannot be constructed using ready-made
					'Lego kits or any ready-made mechanism. They can make use of
					ready-made gear assemblies. Violating this clause will lead
					to disqualification of the team.<br />
					GAME RULES:<br />
					• Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed.<br />
					• When the autonomous bot starts, no team member is allowed
					to touch the bot.<br />
					• At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the
					starting point. Only one team member is allowed to be near
					the game field while starting the bot.<br />
					• The run will start only when the organizers give the
					signal.<br />
					• The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and
					should not involve giving the bot any manual force or
					impulse in any direction.<br />
					• A total of 5 minutes and 45 seconds will be given. The bot
					has to finish the Dry Run and the Actual Runin that period
					only.<br />
					• Only one member of the team is allowed to handle the
					bot.<br />
					• Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the
					arena other than the bot.<br />
					• The time measured by the organizers will be final and will
					be used for scoring the teams.<br />
					• Time measured by any contestant by any other means is not
					acceptable for scoring.<br />
					• In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organizers'
					decision will be final and binding.<br />
					• The organizers reserve the right to change any or all of
					the above rules as they deem fit.<br />
					• The contestant must not alter the bot in any manner that
					reduces its weight (e.g., removal of a bulky sensor array or
					switching to lighter batteries to get better speed). The
					organizers reserve the right to arbitrate in such
					circumstances.<br />
					1.5. RESTRICTIONS:<br />
					• The participants are allowed to take a maximum of 3
					restarts in the entire match.<br />
					• If the bot needs to restart in the first part (Dry Run) of
					the competition, it must do so from the checkpoint.<br />
					• Once Dry Run is completed by the bot, the team won't be
					given any other chance for Dry Run.<br />
					• If the bot needs to restart in the second part (Actual
					Run) of the competition, it has to start from the starting
					zone of the arena. The timer will not be set back to zero
					and will not be paused in any case.<br />
					• During a restart, a contestant must not feed information
					about the arena to the bot.<br />
					1.6. TEAM SPECIFICATIONS:<br />
					• A team may consist of 2 members<br />
